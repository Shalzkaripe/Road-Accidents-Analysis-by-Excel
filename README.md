## Project Overview

This project analyzes road traffic accident data using Excel to identify patterns and trends affecting road safety. It focuses on factors contributing to accidents and casualty rates, offering insights to guide preventive measures and improve traffic management. The goal is to highlight key areas for action to reduce accidents and enhance public safety.

## Data Sources
The road traffic accidents dataset was obtained from Kaggle, offering detailed accident records for thorough analysis and insights.

Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the Initial Data Preparation Phase, following tasks were performed:

Data Loading and Inspection
Handling Missing/Duplicate Values/Incorrect Values
Data Cleaning and formatting
A separate worksheet was created with 12 key columns selected from the original 32.
The purpose was to streamline the analysis and reduce file size.
Only necessary columns were chosen to focus on relevant insights.
As this was a personal project, the decision to use specific columns was made to simplify the process.
The full dataset with all original columns is available if needed.
Data Analysis
"Pivot tables" and "Pivot charts" in Excel were used to analyze the road traffic accident data. These tools enabled quick identification of key patterns and insights, such as trends in casualties and factors influencing accidents.

Analysis Focus Areas:
Total casualties
Daytime effects
Age of casualties
Weather conditions
Road surface conditions
Casualties distribution by weekdays
Number of vehicles involved with casualties
Data Visualization
An interactive dashboard was created in Excel to provide a quick summary of all the insights discovered during the analysis, allowing for easy exploration and interpretation of key findings.

Analysis Insights
Total Casualties:

Identified trends and patterns in the overall number of casualties: 6,902.
Casualties Distribution by Weekdays:

Higher incidents noted on weekends.
Number of Vehicles Involved:

Analyzed the relationship between vehicle count and casualty severity:
Most accidents occurred with 2 vehicles involved.
Age of Casualties:

Most affected age group: 31-50 years.
Road Surface Conditions:

High accident rates observed on dry roads.
Weather Conditions:

Most accidents occurred under normal weather conditions, particularly involving females.
Daytime Effects:

The majority of accidents occurred during daylight hours.

Limitations
The project is a very simple introduction to data analysis, focusing on basic insights derived from the data using pivot tables. It does not explore complex analytical techniques, limiting the depth of the findings. The results are presented in a straightforward dashboard format, suitable for beginners but not for advanced analysis.
