## Project Overview

This project analyzes road traffic accident data using Excel to identify patterns and trends affecting road safety. It focuses on factors contributing to accidents and casualty rates, offering insights to guide preventive measures and improve traffic management. The goal is to highlight key areas for action to reduce accidents and enhance public safety.

## Data Sources

The road traffic accidents dataset was obtained from Kaggle, offering detailed accident records for thorough analysis and insights.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

The following steps were completed during data preparation:  

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
2. **Fixing Missing, Duplicate, and Incorrect Values**  
3. **Data Cleaning and Formatting**  
   - Selected 12 key columns from the original 32 to focus on important insights.  
   - Created a new worksheet to streamline analysis and reduce file size.  
   - Simplified the dataset for this personal project by using only the necessary columns.  
   - The full dataset with all original columns is available if needed.  

## Data Analysis

Pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel were used to analyze the road traffic accident data. These tools helped to identify key patterns and insights, such as trends in casualties and factors influencing accidents.

**Analysis Focus Areas:**  
- Total casualties  
- Daytime effects  
- Age of casualties  
- Weather conditions  
- Road surface conditions  
- Casualties distribution by weekdays  
- Number of vehicles involved with casualties  

## Data Visualization

An interactive dashboard was created in Excel to summarize the key insights from the analysis. This dashboard allows for easy exploration and interpretation of the findings.  

## Analysis Insights

1. **Total Casualties**  
   - The total number of casualties identified was 6,902, with notable trends and patterns observed.  

2. **Casualties Distribution by Weekdays**  
   - Higher incidents were recorded on weekends compared to weekdays.  

3. **Number of Vehicles Involved**  
   - Most accidents involved two vehicles, highlighting a strong relationship between vehicle count and casualty severity.  

4. **Age of Casualties**  
   - The most affected age group was between 31-50 years.  

5. **Road Surface Conditions**  
   - Dry roads had the highest accident rates, indicating surface conditions as a key factor.  

6. **Weather Conditions**  
   - The majority of accidents occurred under normal weather conditions, with a significant proportion involving females.  

7. **Daytime Effects**  
   - Most accidents happened during daylight hours, reflecting the impact of daytime conditions on road safety.

## Limitations

This project provides a basic introduction to data analysis, focusing on simple insights derived using pivot tables. It does not include advanced analytical techniques, which limits the depth of the findings. The results are presented in a straightforward dashboard format, making it suitable for beginners but not for advanced analysis.
