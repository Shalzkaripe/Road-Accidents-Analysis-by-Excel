## Data Cleaning/Preparation

The following steps were completed during data preparation:  

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
2. **Fixing Missing, Duplicate, and Incorrect Values**  
3. **Data Cleaning and Formatting**  
   - Created a new worksheet to streamline analysis and reduce file size.  
   - Simplified the dataset for this personal project by using only the necessary columns.  
   - The full dataset with all original columns is available if needed.  

## Data Analysis

Pivot tables and pivot charts in Excel were used to analyze the road traffic accident data. These tools helped to identify key patterns and insights, such as trends in casualties and factors influencing accidents.

**Analysis Focus Areas:**  
- Total casualties    
- Weather conditions  
- Road surface conditions  
- Casualties distribution by year 
- Vehicle types involved with casualties  

## Data Visualization

An interactive dashboard was created in Excel to summarize the key insights from the analysis. This dashboard allows for easy exploration and interpretation of the findings.  

## Analysis Insights

1. **Total Casualties**  
   - The total number of casualties identified was 4,17883 with notable trends and patterns observed.  

2. **Casualties Distribution by Urban/ Rural**  
   - Higher incidents were recorded on Urban compared to Rural.  

3. **Number of Vehicles Involved**  
   - Most accidents involved Cars, highlighting a strong relationship between vehicle count and casualty severity.  


4. **Road Surface Conditions**  
   - Dry roads had the highest accident rates, indicating surface conditions as a key factor.  


5. **Daytime Effects**  
   - Most accidents happened during daylight hours, reflecting the impact of daytime conditions on road safety.  



## Limitations

This project provides a basic introduction to data analysis, focusing on simple insights derived using pivot tables. It does not include advanced analytical techniques, which limits the depth of the findings. The results are presented in a straightforward dashboard format, making it suitable for beginners but not for advanced analysis.
